# Codeforces Contest Solutions

## What
This repository is created to contain solutions of the codeforces contest (of any level).

This is, obviously :) ,  updated after the contest.

### Possible enhancements
It can be tried to add hints and approaches as well.

### Contribution
This can be used to increase your number of contributions in the open source with some good-first-issues.
Please feel free to add any solution of any contest. Just create the correct hierarchy, and copy-paste one test case from the contest itself.
Adding test is only limited to C++ files for now, as there is an action created which automatically runs the solutions with the test cases.

### Step by Step guide on How to add a solution -
* Move to src directory.
* Create a directory named with the contest ID. Ex: Round984
* Inside that directory, add individual solutions with file name set to question name.
* For C++ only, add tests also -
* Move to test directory, create a directory named same as that of created in src. Ex: Round984
* Add 2 files - QuestionName_test_cases.txt and QuestionNmae_expected_output.txt [You can pick this from the contest itself]
